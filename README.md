# Tetris Game

This is a Tetris game that I made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a simple and fun game that you can play on your browser.

# How to play
You can use the arrow keys to move and rotate the pieces. The goal is to fill horizontal lines with blocks and clear them. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.

Features
The game is responsive, so you can play it on your mobile browser as well.
The game has a score system that increases as you clear lines and levels.
The game has a sound effect that plays the song "Korobeiniki", Tetris' iconic theme song when you click on the Volume icon.

# Credits
This game was inspired by a homework that I had at Academia de CÃ³digo, where I learned to program in 14 weeks. The homework was about Tetris and was presented by a colleague who made me know the history of the game and its creator, Alexey Pajitnov, who developed Tetris in 1984 in the Soviet Union.

I hope you enjoy my game and have fun!
